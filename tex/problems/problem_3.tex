\subsection{Problem Statement}

In the game of Can't Stop Simplified, each of two players has a stack of coins of some size $n$. On their turn, a player may flip a coin. If it is heads, they remove a coin from their stack. If it is tails their turn ends and all coins that were removed that turn go back onto their stack. A player can also choose to stop flipping a coin at any given time, at which point all coins removed that turn will be permanently removed from that player's stack and their turn ends.

What is the optimal strategy for this game?

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

None.

\subsection{Progress}

A dynamic programming algorithm for solving the problem was created by Alex Meiburg (unfortunately, I don't have access to the source code). This algorithm was also double-checked with some manual caluclations by myself.

It was conjectured by Martin Shoosterman that the optimal play would be to take about $-1/\log p$ coins and stop (where $p$ is the probability of getting heads), but this turned out not to be the case.

\subsection{Related problems}

We can also consider $p$ other than 1/2 or a number of players other than just 2. As this game was inspired by a very popular title on Board Game Arena (a website that hosts online board games), we can also consider making the game more similar to this game and then solving it.
