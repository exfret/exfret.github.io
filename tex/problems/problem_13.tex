\subsection{Problem statement}

How many of the squares in an infinite grid of unit squares can we fully surround by a piecewise linear path of length $L$?

A path of length $4+4\sqrt2$ can cover 12 squares fully.

\subsection{Comments and clarifications}

None.

\subsection{Progress}

It was noted that this is similar to the Gauss circle problem, and that the right answer is probably circle-ish, but it is unknown. We can at least bound the answer between two circles of constant radius difference using the isoperimetric inequality.

\subsection{Related problems}

In general, one can consider polytopes of a given surface measure. We can also consider other metrics on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
