\subsection{Problem statement}

See title.

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

Rays include their endpoints.

\subsection{Progress}

The answer is known to be ``probably not".

\subsection{Related problems}

We can also ask about rays partitioning other sets. Are there any natural ways rays can partition sets like $\mathbb{R}^3$?
