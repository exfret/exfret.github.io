\subsection{Problem statement}

What are all solutions in the complex plane to the equation $z^{(z^{(z^z)})}=((z^z)^z)^z$?

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

It is unclear to me how the author intends us to proceed in the case where $z^z$ has multiple values. My best guess is to allow $z$ to be in the solution set if there is some branch cut of $\mathbb{C}^2$ that allows the two sides of the equation to have a value and be equal for this given $z$.

\subsection{Progress}

It is thought that there are three values (excluding zero). These are $-1, 1$, and a weird value between 1.5 and 2. Ben Emmerson has found this third value to be $\exp(W(\log 3))\approx 1.8255$ where $W$ is Lambert's W function.

\subsection{Related problems}

We can in general consider other equations that ``test" the power associativity of complex numbers.
