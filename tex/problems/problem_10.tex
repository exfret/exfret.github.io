\subsection{Problem statement}

Let $S$ be the set of infinite sequences over $\{0,1\}$. Let $f:S\to S$ satisfy the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $f$ is a bijection.
  \item If $x\in S$ is eventually periodic, so is $f^{-1}(x)$.
  \item The $x$ and $y$ agree on their first $k$ entries and disagree on their $k+1$-th if and only if $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ agree on their first $k$ entries and disagree on their $k+1$-th.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Comments and clarifications}

The third condition can be equivalently stated that

\BlankLine

$\Big[$ $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k)=(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_k)$ \textit{and} $x_{k+1}\neq y_{k+1}$ $\Big]$

\BlankLine

if and only if

\BlankLine

$\Big[$ $(f(x)_1,f(x)_2,\ldots,f_(x)_k)=(f(y)_1,f(y)_2,\ldots,f(y)_k)$ \textit{and} $f(x)_{k+1}\neq f(y)_{k+1}$ $\Big]$.

\subsection{Progress}

Several counterexamples have been given in the comments, but I haven't verified them yet.

\subsection{Related problems}

None.
