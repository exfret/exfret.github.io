\subsection{Problem statement}

Let $X$ be a connected separable topological space. Is it true that for any infinite countable dense subsets $A,B\subset X$, there is a homeomorphism $f:X\to X$ that takes $A$ to $B$? In general, what conditions can we put on $X$ for this to be true?

\subsection{Comments and clarifications}

This problem is inspired by the case where $X=\mathbb{R}^n$, where the statement is true.

\subsection{Progress}

Of course, almost any topological space with non-transitive self-homeomorphism group won't work. As one example, we can take the subset $\{(x,y)\vert x=0\textrm{ or }y=0\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$.

\subsection{Related problems}

None.
