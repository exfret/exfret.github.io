\subsection{Problem statement}

Let $p_1,p_2,p_3,s$ be three points in the first quadrant of $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $t$ be a point in the third quadrant. You are allowed to move $s$ to a new points $s'$ so long as $s'$ is closer to two of $p_1,p_2,p_3$ than $s$ was. Show that we can replace $s$ with $t$ after some finite number of moves.

The blue dot is $s$, and $p_1,p_2,p_3$ are $A,B,C$ respectively. $t$ is the red point. The green point shows a possible ``move". In this interpretation, judges $A,B,C$ are trying to pass a law as close to their current position in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as possible. The initial law is unicorn rights, and you are trying to pass a series of amendments to have mass necromancy (the red point) passed instead.

\subsection{Comments and clarifications}

This can be thought of a slippery slope demonstration, where the $p_i$'s are ``judges", and the movements are amendments to a given bill. Given their position, the fact that we can essentially make successive amendments to change the bill to our whim demonstrates the ``slippery slope" nature of bill amendments.

\subsection{Progress}

The OP said this was possible, but no solution has been given. Perhaps the solution was too long to fit in the margins.

\subsection{Related problems}

We can consider $n+1$ judges in general position in $\mathbb{R}^n$, or even more judges in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with a majority (or perhaps more or less than a majority) needing to be reached.
