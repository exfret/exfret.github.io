\subsection{Problem statement}

At times $t=1,2,3,\ldots$ a particle is leaves from the origin traveling right at a velocity uniformly (and independently) randomly chosen from $[0,1]$. If two particles collide, they disappear (this happens when a faster particle ``catches up" to a slower one). What is the probability that a particle escapes to infinity?

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

Solving for the finite case and taking the limit won't work. As an example, the probability is 1 when $n$ is odd, simply because only two particles collide at a time. Thus, parity is of great concern, which clearly shouldn't matter for the infinite case. Maybe there is a way to reduce to the finite case with more finesse, but all past attempts have failed.
