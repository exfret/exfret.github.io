\subsection{Problem statement}

A star concave set always has at least one point inside from which there is a line of sight to any other boundary point. Let $C(J)$ be the set of such points.

\begin{lemma}
  The following are true.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $C(J)$ is convex and closed.
    \item If $K$ is convex, then $C(K)=K$.
    \item If $K$ is smooth and star concave, then $C(K)$ is smooth and contains an open ball.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

Is it possible for us to find a set $F$ whose boundary has fractal dimension strictly more than one and such that $C(F)$ contains a nonempty ball.

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

I have tried looking up the definition of star concave but can't find it. It's not necessary to solve the problem, though.

\subsection{Progress}

There are claims in the comments that such a set must fail to have a lipschitz boundary and that such a set must have a lipschitz boundary. I haven't had time to vet either, but if these claims are both true, it would imply that such a shape doesn't exist (there are also suggestions about how to make such a shape, so who really knows).

\subsection{Related problems}

None.
