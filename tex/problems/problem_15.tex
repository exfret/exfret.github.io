\subsection{Problem statement}

Define the polynomials $p_{n,m}(k)$ via $p_{n,0}(k)=1$ and when $m>0$,

$$p_{n,m}(k)=(k-n+m)p_{n,m-1}(k)-p_{n-1,m-1}(k)$$

For a fixed value $N\geq 0$, what is the smallest value of $k$ so that $p_{N,N}(k)\geq 0$ and for all $0\leq m\leq n\leq N$ we have that $p_{m,n}(k)>0$?

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

This problem was inspired by Kaya's research into abstract homotopy theory.

For each $n,m$, $p_{n,m}(k)$ is a polynomial in $k$. Here are some particular values for various $n,m$.

$$p_{n,1}(k)=(k-n+1)-1=k-n$$

$$p_{n,2}(k)=(k-n+1)(k-n)-(k-(n-1))$$

$$=k^2-2nk+n^2-1$$

\subsection{Progress}

The problem was later solved by Kaya using categorical and topological methods (I'm too dumb to explain how even though they explained the method to me).

\subsection{Related problems}

None.
