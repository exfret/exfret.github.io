\subsection{Problem statement}

Suppose there is a village, and that on a nearby mountain there lives a bloodthirsty vampire. Each night, the vampire goes down to the village and eats someone. The only way to kills the vampire is to poison a certain number of people each night and hope that the vampire eats one of the poisoned people. Regardless of whether they were eaten, every poisoned person dies the next day.

What strategy (number of people poisoned given the number of people in the village) maximizes the expected number of people who survive?

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

None.

\subsection{Progress}

Via dynamic programming, it was found that the answer is $\sqrt{n}$ for $n$ people in the village, with a few weird exceptions.

\subsection{Related problems}

None that I have taken the time to write down, but there are some ideas in the comments for a continuous analogue.
