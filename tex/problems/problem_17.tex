\subsection{Problem statement}

The following terminology is mine, not Griffin's.

\begin{definition}[Missing set]
  Let $M$ be a set of natural numbers (don't include zero). Say $S\subset\mathbb{N}$ is an $M$-missing set if the pairwise intersections $m_1S\cap m_2S$ are empty for each $m_1,m_2\in M$.
\end{definition}

What is the maximum upper density of $S\cup 2S\cup 3S$ if $S$ is a $\{1,2,3\}$-missing set?

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

Given a set of naturals $S$ and a natural number $n$, the set $nS$ is simply the set of all $ns$ for $s\in S$.

The upper density of a set $S\subset\mathbb{N}$ is defined to be the value of $\limsup_n card(S_n)/n$ where $S_n=S\cap\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $card(X)$ is the cardinality of the set $X$.

\subsection{Progress}

If the upper density exists, it is known to have value at most 11/12.

\subsection{Related problems}

Of course, we can consider $M$-missing sets for $M$ other than $\{1,2,3\}$.
