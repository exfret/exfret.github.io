\subsection{Problem statement}

Let $0\leq b\leq a\leq\infty$. Do there exist \textit{enumerations} of the positive rationals $\{q_n\},\{r_n\}$ so that $\limsup(q_n/r_n)=a$ and $\liminf(q_n/r_n)=b$.

\subsection{Comments and clarifications}

The sequences $q_n,r_n$ must be enumerations of the rationals (that is, each rational is included exactly once in each sequence).

\subsection{Progress}

The answer, given by John River in the comments, is essentially ``yes, but it's complicated". However, his proof was only a sketch, so take it with a grain of salt.

\subsection{Related problems}

None.
