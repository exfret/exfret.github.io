\subsection{Problem statement}

Let $X$ be a set with 6 elements. Consider the permutation $\sigma=(1\ 2\ 3\ 4)(5\ 6)$. Which topologies on $X$ make $\sigma:X\to X$ continuous?

Warmup: Same question, but $\sigma=(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5\ 6)$

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

None.

\subsection{Progress}

The answer to the warmup problem is 4. In general, if we consider a set of size $n$ and an $n$-cycle, then the number of topologies making the $n$-cycle continuous is $d(n)+1$ where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$.

The answer to the main question is probably 17, but is unconfirmed.

\subsection{Related problems}

We can, of course, ask about other permutations, or even families of permutations, or even other functions on finite sets. The sky's the limit.
