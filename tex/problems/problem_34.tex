\subsection{Problem statement}

Given some number of vertices $n$, which connected subgraphs of the 2D lattice grid with $n$ vertices have the most spanning trees?

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

A spanning tree is a connected subgraph of a graph containing each vertex of the original graph and no cycles.

The 2D lattice grid is simply the infinite graph with vertices $(a,b)$ with $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ and edges between each $(a,b)$ and $(a+1,b),(a-1,b),(a,b+1),(a,b-1)$. There are no ``diagonal" edges.

\subsection{Progress}

It is conjectured that a square is optimal.

\subsection{Related problems}

We can, of course, generalize to multidimensional lattice graphs or other infinite graphs.
