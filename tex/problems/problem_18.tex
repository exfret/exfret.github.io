\section{Does a sum of sine values converge?}

\subsection{Problem statement}

Let $\Theta(n)=1$ if $n>0$ and $\Theta(n)=0$ otherwise. Is it true that the following series diverges:

$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sin(2^{2^n})$$

\subsection{Clarifications and comments}

The question is essentially whether the sine function is positive infinitely often on the set $\{2^{2^0},2^{2^1},\ldots\}$. This may seem intuitively clear, but actually proving it seems to be incredibly difficult.

\subsection{Progress}

Not much.

\subsection{Related problems}

We can change the function $2^{2^n}$ to other functions. For $n$ it is trivial, and for $2^n$ it actually has a relatively simple solution.
